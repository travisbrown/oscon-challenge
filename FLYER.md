Twitter Challenge at OSCON 2014
===============================

[Co-occurrence networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_networks)
are often used to infer social networks from mentions of names in a set of
documents. This Scala coding challenge invites you to create a co-occurence
network from your personal Twitter archive, and to discover some facts about the
Twitter users in that network, including which have the highest
[degree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28graph_theory%29),
[node strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_network), and (for extra
credit) [centrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_centrality#Degree_centrality).

We provide a sample archive together with correct output, and will be
evaluating submissions against [@TwitterOSS](https://twitter.com/TwitterOSS)'s
tweets, but we encourage you to download your own archive for development.

The challenge should take between 15 minutes and an hour, with the two extra
credit questions possibly requiring a little more time and thought.

If you're interested in participating, check out the following
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/travisbrown/oscon-challenge) for the full
problem description, sample data, and submission instructions:

Submit your answer by midnight on Tuesday, July 22, for a chance to win some
Twitter swag!

Let us know if you have any questions, either in person at the Twitter OSS booth
or at [@TwitterOSS](https://twitter.com/TwitterOSS)!
